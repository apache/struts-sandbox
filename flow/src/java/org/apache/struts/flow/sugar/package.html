    <title>Struts Flow - Sugar</title>
</head>
<body>
    This package contains syntactic "sugar" in the form of function extensions for 
    Java core classes.  It also contains wrappers for the Collections interfaces to make
    their information accessible through normal javascript techniques.  This package doesn't depend on 
    any other Struts Flow classes and can be used with any other embedded instance of Rhino.
