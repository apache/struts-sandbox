/**
 * A reentrant mutual exclusion {@link Lock} with the same basic
 * behavior and semantics as the implicit monitor lock accessed using
 * <tt>synchronized</tt> methods and statements, but with extended
 * capabilities.
 * <p/>
 * <p> A <tt>ReentrantLock</tt> is <em>owned</em> by the thread last
 * successfully locking, but not yet unlocking it. A thread invoking
 * <tt>lock</tt> will return, successfully acquiring the lock, when
 * the lock is not owned by another thread. The method will return
 * immediately if the current thread already owns the lock. This can
 * be checked using methods {@link #isHeldByCurrentThread}, and {@link
 * #getHoldCount}.
 * <p/>
 * <p> The constructor for this class accepts an optional
 * <em>fairness</em> parameter.  When set <tt>true</tt>, under
 * contention, locks favor granting access to the longest-waiting
 * thread.  Otherwise this lock does not guarantee any particular
 * access order.  Programs using fair locks accessed by many threads
 * may display lower overall throughput (i.e., are slower; often much
 * slower) than those using the default setting, but have smaller
 * variances in times to obtain locks and guarantee lack of
 * starvation. Note however, that fairness of locks does not guarantee
 * fairness of thread scheduling. Thus, one of many threads using a
 * fair lock may obtain it multiple times in succession while other
 * active threads are not progressing and not currently holding the
 * lock.
 * Also note that the untimed {@link #tryLock() tryLock} method does not
 * honor the fairness setting. It will succeed if the lock
 * is available even if other threads are waiting.
 * <p/>
 * <p> It is recommended practice to <em>always</em> immediately
 * follow a call to <tt>lock</tt> with a <tt>try</tt> block, most
 * typically in a before/after construction such as:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * class X {
 *   private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
 *   // ...
 * <p/>
 *   public void m() {
 *     lock.lock();  // block until condition holds
 *     try {
 *       // ... method body
 *     } finally {
 *       lock.unlock()
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * <p>In addition to implementing the {@link Lock} interface, this
 * class defines methods <tt>isLocked</tt> and
 * <tt>getLockQueueLength</tt>, as well as some associated
 * <tt>protected</tt> access methods that may be useful for
 * instrumentation and monitoring.
 * <p/>
 * <p> Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in
 * locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of
 * its state when serialized.
 * <p/>
 * <p> This lock supports a maximum of 2147483648 recursive locks by
 * the same thread.
